// The T&S Casual Employment Agreement (Traffic Controller — Civil
// Construction) as structured data. Single source of truth: the public
// signing page, the PDF renderer and the admin preview all render from
// this file, so what the worker reads, what they sign and what lands in
// the archive can never drift apart.
//
// Clause text is transcribed verbatim from the reviewed agreement
// (TS-Casual-Employment-Agreement-Traffic-Control). Do not paraphrase or
// "tidy" wording here without legal review — the drafting choices
// (casual status, s.545A set-off, award references, consent vs waiver)
// are deliberate. See the onboarding-pack review notes.
//
// {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens are resolved from a contract's fields_json via
// interpolate(). **bold** markers survive into both renderers: the HTML
// view converts them to <strong>, the PDF strips them and uses them as
// emphasis boundaries.
